    "A heap is a specific type of tree with some of its own additional rules. In a heap, elements are arranged in increasing or decreasing order, such that the root element is either the maximum or minimum value in the tree. There are two different types of heaps. Max heaps & min heaps that capture those two situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a max heap, a parent must always have a greater value than its child so the root ends up being the biggest element. \n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite is true for min heaps: A parent has a lower value than its child, so the root is the minimum element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps don't need to be binary trees, so parents can have any number of children. Operations like search, insert, and delete can vary a lot based on the type of heap being used. \n",

    "* The root is the maximum element\n",
    "* Must be a complete tree:\n",
    "  * All levels except the last one are completely full\n",

    "* Peek(): Gets the maximum value. $O(1)$\n",
    "* Search: $O(N)$\n",

    "  * Stick the element into the next open spot in the tree.\n",
    "  * Heapify: Reorder the tree based on the heap property.\n",
    "    * Since we care that our parent element is bigger than its child, we just need to keep comparing our new element with its parent and swapping them when the child is bigger. \n",
    "* Extract: $O(log(N))$ (i.e. the height of the tree)\n",
    "  * The root is remove from the tree\n",

    "### Heap Implementation\n",
    "Though heaps are represented as trees, they're actually often stored as arrays. That's because we know how many children its parent has, and thus how many nodes will be at each level, we can use math to figure out where the next node will fall in the array and then traverse the tree. \n",
