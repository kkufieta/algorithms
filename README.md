# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repo is a collection of code snippets I worked through while studying Data Structures & Algorithms. 

The resources I am using are varied, but include most prominently:
1. Cracking the Coding Interview
2. Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree at Udacity
3. Coursera: Algorithms at Princeton University
4. Daily Coding Problem
